# FootShop-Monitor

Hello Welcome to Lil Chuks FootShop Monitor. 

This is just some example code to show off my skillsets.

The code has A LOT of comments and should be really simple to understand.

To get started just clone the repo and then in terminal do node main.js

This is a REALLY early version of the monitor. It is basically just a proof of concept. The current rewritten monitor that I am using uses proxy rotation in order to monitor the site with 0 delay to pick up any changes as fast as possible. This can’t be done on this version as it does not have proxy support and you will get banned quickly for spamming the footshop api. 

Don’t steal my code, I can run the monitor for you for free on any drop just message me on discord Lil Chuk#0001
